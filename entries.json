We had 17 employees and 3 kids this year...not bad for a small company.  I'm always impressed with the can-do spirit of the folks that come out for this.  For some of them, it's their one run of the year and going from \"Couch to 5K\" in one day takes some grit.  I ran with Donnell, the 11 year old son of one of our employees who wasn't running.  He started running track last year so I asked him \"what distance(s) did you run\"?  A bit shy, \"mile\" was all he said.  \"You look pretty fast.  How fast do you run the mile?\"  \"5:45\" he said, as if that were perfectly normal for an 11 year old.  He hadn't run in the last 4 months though and had never run longer than a mile...or in a massive crowd which he seemed pretty nervous about.  I gave him instructions about how to pace it and told him to wait at the finish...figuring he would probably beat all of us.  We started about 7 rows back from the front and when the gun went off, all of his angst about running in a crowed vanished and all of that advice about pace was forgotten.  Donnell had one goal...win.  I started way too fast for me (6:50 ish) and he was disappearing fast.  I caught up to him just after 1200 m...he was taking a walk break.  I could tell that he'd \"left it all\" in the first 1200 but he never complained and continued to sprint / walk the rest of the way.  When we passed the clock at 3.0 I told him \"half a lap of the track...GO!\" and he was gone in a blink.  Donnell has great competitive spirit and I really enjoyed running with him.","comments":[{"body":"What a great story!

Great racing weather...mid 40s and overcast.  It was a little windy in spots but not too bad.  I tucked in behind a Clydesdale for the first 5 miles.  Could not believe how fast the crowd took off at the start.  I purposely started farther back than I normally might and still got passed like I was walking by about 30 runners.  I thought, these *must* be 5K runners.  Nope.  800m in 5K and 15K runners split and as it turns out many of those folks were in the long race.  Somewhere around 1200m I started passing people that were already gasping and wheezing.  I felt kinda sluggish the first couple miles but that feeling faded quickly.  By mile 3 I was rolling along at a \"comfortable\" race pace.  The plan wasn't to kill myself...just test the waters.  For miles 3 - 7 I tried to maintain that effort level and let the hills dictate the pace.  I figured if I had a lot left in the tank I'd go a little faster  in 8 & 9.  I felt pretty good starting mile 8 and cranked up the effort.  Unfortunately about half of mile 8 was up hill so that effort only served to maintain pace.  Still feeling good at the start of mile 9 I picked it up again but tried to be careful not to get too carried away...just focused on steadily picking people off.\n\nI'm happy with the effort.  Pacing was pretty good...which is always a challenge for me.  This was my first race in the Asics Gel-Banditos...great shoes.

From there we headed into town...Mooresville, NC...which is the small town where we live just outside of Charlotte.  They got a big kick out of riding their bikes by the (other) park where they played baseball, The Charles Mack Citizen's Center where we occasionally go for meetings and the library.  They were still feeling good and asked how far it was to Alex's house...another friend.  So, we headed out of town a couple miles to Alex's house who was surprised to see the boys ride up on bikes.  They were starting to show some signs of wear so we headed home after that.  My younger son took a hard spill on the way back, ending up with a little road rash on the elbows and what I feared was a sprained / broken thumb.  We were still a few miles from the house so my wife picked him up. (He's fine...no major drama).  The rest of the ride home was uneventful.  Overall we had a blast.
